PDF Reader Chatbot
## Overview
The PDF Reader Chatbot is a web-based application built with Streamlit, PyPDF2, FAISS, and Sentence-Transformers. It allows users to upload PDF files, processes them to extract both text and images, and enables users to ask questions based on the contents of the uploaded PDF files.

The chatbot answers user questions by performing a semantic similarity search on the text extracted from the PDF documents. It provides highly relevant responses by searching for the most similar sections in the document to the userâ€™s query. If applicable, it also displays any related images from the PDF files that are relevant to the question asked.
